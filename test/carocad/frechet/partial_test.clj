(comment
  In general the partial Frech√©t distance is the Frechet distance applied
  to two sub-curves taken from the original curves. Thus all the properties
  of the Frechet distance apply \; except the boundary conditions)

(comment The partial frechet distance is NOT a true metric, thus the triangle inequality
         does not hold. This is due to the fact that the part of the curves that matches
         and from which the distance is extracted, are not necessarily the same for the
         three comparisons.)

         distance since the boundaries are relaxed)
